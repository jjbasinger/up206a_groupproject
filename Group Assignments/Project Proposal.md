# Project Proposal
## Research Question
How does projected sea level rise impact New York City's population and real estate market?

### Explanation
These past weeks, the Amtrak train connecting Los Angeles and San Diego has been unavailable to passengers as the ground beneath the coastal railroad tracks has unexpectedly shifted. This threat to the railroad due to coastal erosion and sea movements has shown us how sea level rise already impacts our daily lives and necessary resources, in particular because Jacob lives in San Diego and has to commute to Los Angeles to attend school. On the other side of the world, in Brittany, France, Luciaâ€™s relatives live in a peninsula where sea level rise is already clearly observable, threatening homes and changing how new ones are built to be more flood/water resilient. In many other areas of the world, populations are forced to either leave their lifelong homes as their neighborhoods become unlivable, adapt their structures to the risk of flood, or live in unsafe housing, all due to sea level rise. This research question is important because it may provide the opportunity to take a step toward becoming more resilient and adaptable to sea level rise by showing how it can affect people and their communities.

### Spatial Scope
In New York City, 2012's Hurricane Sandy revealed the vulnerability of certain local waterfront areas, in particular southern Manhattan and the southern shores of Staten Island. Entire communities are already being displaced as the city buys houses in areas threatened by severe storms and sea level rise. In response, architect Simon David has been mandated to work on making the city more resilient to this phenomenon by erecting walls to protect Manhattan from the water. 
We decided to focus on the New York City area because it is emblematic of the struggle to deal with sea level rise today, and to prepare for inevitable upcoming changes. In the NYC area, sea level is projected to rise by two meters before the end of the century. Furthermore, since the NYC metropolitan area is the most densely populated urban area in the United States, its exposure to sea level rise is a particularly critical menace.

## Data Sources
We will combine multiple data sources to illustrate how sea level rise is affecting, or will affect, New York City.
- **Sea Level Rise Data**
  - Description: This data depicts projected sea levels in New York City under multiple sea level rise scenarios.
  - Source: NYC OpenData, https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=sea+level+rise
- **Flood Insurance Data**
  - Description: Flood Insurance Rate Maps that are provided by FEMA lay out different risk levels for coastal and flood-prone areas. Each of these risk levels corresponds with a specific insurance rate. Flood Insurance data is provided at the county level, so we will combine data from each of the five counties that are represented in New York City. We chose to use this data in addition to the projected sea level rise information because it may be a better reflection of how sea level rise is actually represented at a fiscal level (insurance rates that go up due to projected flooding may impact the other variables more than just projections of sea level rise). It will also be interesting to compare the projected sea level rise data with the flood insurance data to see how they match up.

- **American Community Survey Data**
  - Description: The ACS data provides demographic, social, and economic information for New York City. This data is available at the census block, census tract, and neighborhood levels, but we will likely focus on the census block and tract levels because they will be most helpful for determining trends related to sea level rise. This data also contains information about housing values, which we can use to supplement the other real estate data below.

- **Housing Market and Real Estate Data**
  - Description: This property value and assessment data provides the value of real estate in New York City. This assessment is performed by the City and updated every year, so we can use this data to determine how property values are changing in various locations.

## Intended Analysis and Visualizations
We plan to visualize sea level rise's impacts on New York City. To do so, we plan to create two independent variables:
1. Sea level rise data that depicts projected sea level rise.
2. Insurance rate data that depicts insurance rates associated with predicted flooding.

Then, we plan to compare that data with multiple dependent variables:
1. ACS data at the census tract or census block level. We will show population changes, social indicators, and economic indicators. By comparing projected sea level rise to this information we can analyze whether it has had an impact on those locations that are most vulnerable.
2. Property value data. By looking at changes in property values we can analyze whether projected sea level rise and/or changes in flood insurance rates are impacting the assessed values of real estate in New York City.

We plan to visualize the data by adding it to a map of New York City. The projected sea level rise will likely serve as the base layer, which can then be compared with the other variables through toggling on and off. We hope that this visualization will answer the research question by showing where the demographic, social, economic, and financial changes are located in relation to projected sea levels.
## Conclusion
We hope that this research can illuminate how sea level rise is impacting coastal areas of New York City. By comparing projected sea level rise and flood insurance rates with demographic, social, economic, and real estate data, this project will create a comprehensive picture of how communities are affected by climate change.  We hope that by answering these questions we can determine the extent to which projected sea level rise is changing behaviors and economies.  We also hope that this information can be used to better prepare for the impacts of climate change, and to better protect the populations that may be the most vulnerable.
