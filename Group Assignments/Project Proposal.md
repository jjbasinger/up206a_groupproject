# Project Proposal
## Research Question
How does projected sea level rise impact populations and the real estate market in New York City?
### Explanation

### Spatial Scope

## Data Sources
We will combine multiple data sources to illustrate how sea level rise is affecting, or will affect, New York City.
- **Sea Level Rise Data**
  - Description: This data depicts projected sea levels in New York City under multiple sea level rise scenarios.
  - Source: NYC OpenData, https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=sea+level+rise
- **Flood Insurance Data**
  - Description: Flood Insurance Rate Maps that are provided by FEMA lay out different risk levels for coastal and flood-prone areas. Each of these risk levels corresponds with a specific insurance rate. Flood Insurance data is provided at the county level, so we will combine data from each of the five counties that are represented in New York City. We chose to use this data in addition to the projected sea level rise information because it may be a better reflection of how sea level rise is actually represented at a fiscal level (insurance rates that go up due to projected flooding may impact the other variables more than just projections of sea level rise). It will also be interesting to compare the projected sea level rise data with the flood insurance data to see how they match up.

- **American Community Survey Data**
  - Description: The ACS data provides demographic, social, and economic information for New York City. This data is available at the census block, census tract, and neighborhood levels, but we will likely focus on the census block and tract levels because they will be most helpful for determining trends related to sea level rise. This data also contains information about housing values, which we can use to supplement the other real estate data below.

- **Housing Market and Real Estate Data**
  - Description: This property value and assessment data provides the value of real estate in New York City. This assessment is performed by the City and updated every year, so we can use this data to determine how property values are changing in various locations.

## Intended Analysis and Visualizations
We plan to visualize sea level rise's impacts on New York City. To do so, we plan to create two independent variables:
1. A sea level rise layer that depicts projected sea level rise.
2. An insurance rate layer that depicts insurance rates associated with predicted flooding.

Then, we plan to compare that data with multiple dependent variables:
1. ACS data at the census tract or census block level. We will show population changes, social indicators, and economic indicators. By comparing projected sea level rise to this information we can analyze whether it has had an impact on those locations that are most vulnerable.
2. Property value data. By looking at changes in property values we can analyze whether projected sea level rise and/or changes in flood insurance rates are impacting the assessed values of real estate in New York City.
## Conclusion
We hope that this research can illuminate how sea level rise is impacting coastal areas of New York City. By comparing projected sea level rise and flood insurance rates with demographic, social, economic, and real estate data, this project will create a comprehensive picture of how communities are affected by climate change.  We hope that by answering these questions we can determine the extent to which projected sea level rise is changing behaviors and economies.  We also hope that this information can be used to better prepare for the impacts of climate change, and to better protect the populations that may be the most vulnerable.
